UNDISTILLED

in pock you don't have to deal with improper lists

my own programming... infrastructure?
	name?
		project?
			too narrow meaning?
		stack?
		toolchain?
			pock and kreck are different
		system?
		family? 
		infrastructure? ***
	
	

not for a team
not for a customer
not for the customer

it's not meant to be closed
	i don't want to write an epub reader

idiocentric

my limitations

"less confusing design choice"
	matters of taste
	matters of non-taste

I want to write unrelated stuff in it some day

idiocentric vs egocentric?
	it's for me by me
	bolstering ego

VV change to "my own?"
idionsyncracy
	idiosyncratic doesn't mean close-minded
		openness

idiocentric doesn't mean close-minded
	openness
	
does it please God?

the big why

the aesthetics

the small picture

theory as a scaffolding
	messy stuff

overthinking
	what I did with refcounts

distilling notes

avoiding stuff that's good but complicated

note taking for the sake of note taking is cringe.
	it's fake knowledge

Being too self-conscious

If I think I could figure it out by doing it, I shouldn't try to figure it out by thinking about it.
Doing it on a computer is just thinking, but more robust.


reasons, justifications
	bloat
	justifying justifications
	justifying justifications of justifications

design vs philosophy?
	check pock

overdoing stuff

overnoting
	justifications take time to write, read and think about
	evaluating against principles takes time
	it takes time
	having too many note files makes 

overdesigning
	urbit's 4-letter naming convention

orphaning thoughts


Writing style
	simple language
		"my own" instead of "idiocentric"
	"I" vs. "you", "we", "one"
	"It suddenly feels different even if I didn't intend it"	

	formal & informal

doing philosophy diligently is harder than programming diligently

if you keep recompiling a program, you know you've been wasting time

if you do it with philosopy, you might trick youreslf into believing that things
make more sense now than they used to.
This may or may not be true, but it's hard to notice when you start just convincing
yourself of your own BS

FizzBuzz Wittgenstein edition

the topic might change

move to meta?
move to meta-meta?

the natural language is for talking to myself and other
people about this whole weird thing

stuff that's not really mathematics
messy
stuff that I can't easily define well
by philosophy I mean

justification is secondary to vision

fun

if stuff violates the principles, the principles might be wrong too

is thinking about philosophy useful?
	thinking about what?

[move to some other file?]
	index?
	meta?
pock
	for deeply understanding machine-independent semantics of programming
	to keep the interpreter simple
	axiomatic
kreck
	not axiomatic
	low floor, high ceiling
VM - tephra
	what?
		not a nock like vm
		a vm that resembles a processor
		why?
			to understand compilers
			so it can be kinda fast
	maybe wasm? it is s-expy already?
		meh, it has types and functions
		I don't like going down with abstractions
kernel
shell
TUI lib
text editor
	why?
		vim, emacs and vscode are bloated
	cool stuff!
	files & trees
debugger

reinventing the wheel

expression expanding lisp debugger

proving that which is reasonably easy to prove
	reasonably easy
		YMMV
