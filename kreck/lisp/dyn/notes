exop is (nil . fun)
it's not just "fun", because it would be confusing
	maybe eval it?
		nil as quote?
	nooo, you use quote for stuff anyway

better dict search?

never invent anything
	should've written a lisp from the beginning
		no, not really
		and it's not completely a lisp

ponder that additional evaluation of op
